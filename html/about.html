      <h2>Why Software Engineering?</h2>
      <p>Ever since I was a kid, I was fascinated by how websites and apps worked. I was influenced by tech innovators and inspired by the idea of building real-world solutions with code. That's what led me to pursue Software Engineering. I believe it's the perfect blend of creativity, logic, and innovation.</p>
